Hi there, this is Keyu. Welcome to my website. I always write down my experiences and share my feelings on life, academic and technology here. 

About me
===
I am a graduate student at Mathematical Department of University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). My supervisor is [Prof. Juyong Zhang](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~juyong/). My research interests fall into the intersection areas of computer vision, computer graphics and machine learning. Specifically, I am interested and working on the following topics:
* 3D Face Shape Representation.
* Facial Expression Transfer.
* 3D Face Reconstruction.
